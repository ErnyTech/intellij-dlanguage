####Easy stuff

- ~~make this and super references~~
  - possible inspection for this and super references where they shouldn't be
- resolve cache
- make MembersIndex respect inheritance **requires template expansion minimum** 
- make MembersIndex respect template mixin **requires template expansion minimum**
- ~~detection of exit points~~
- handle static imports **implement warning as inspection later instead of resolve**
- handle package name resolution
- fix constructor resolve bugs maybe
- refactor resolve tests to allow single file maybe

####Harder stuff

- possible resolve without loading of psi
- handling expression parsing correctly
- template instantiation
- full stub serialization of types
